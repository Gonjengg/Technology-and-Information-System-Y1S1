Reflection

First and foremost, I want to show my gratitude towards both representatives of GetMe Hired and PPG company for the willingness to spend some time to give meaningful talk and advices to students. I learned how to write an impactful CV and what element needed in the CV to increase employment probability. I would say that going to the career development talk was a very meaningful experience. It has inspired me and equipped me with the means to seek a more promising future. I am excited to apply the tactics and guidance I learned from the discussion, and I have no doubt that doing so would enable me to have a better and more effective career.

I was able to get an extensive knowledge of the various departments involved and how everything operates there by hearing the talk and tour at UTM Digital. I was able to see how each department functions after learning more about it. The staff's explanation made me understand more about how things work there. Now, as a data engineering student I am eager to learn more and improve myself to strive in the future like how workers in UTM Digital are.

Reflection 

I learned a bit about history of Credence, what did the provide and what technology did they use. For example, Credence uses ClickHouse and PostgreSQL for their database and uses Python and SQL as their programming languages. Other than that, Credence uses PowerBI and Metabase as their visualization tools. I also did some reasearh on skills needed to be a data engineer. I saw the ranking and learning SQL ranked the first as the skill needed to be a data engineer. Over the course of the incoming years, I intend learn new skills such as new programming languages and refine my existing skill to be a proficient data engineer in the future.

The visit to PETRONAS and HUAWEI are very informative. I learned that PETRONAS are still investigating the digital growth including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, connectivity, security, process automation, and analytics. Next, i have been exposed by HUAWEI's product which are advanced for example Ideahub. The visit to these two companies was an eye-opening experince to me. It made me realize that I need to learn much more to strive as big as those companies are right now. I intend to fill me up with some technical skills and improve my soft skills.
